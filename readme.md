# Monikos

Monikos is a mobile/web study app for pharmacy school students built on [AngularJS][angularjs].

## Introduction

Memorizing and remembering over 200 drugs is difficult! Current pharmacy students have to go to a database to look up these drugs, they then have to take the time to manually make flash cards or put this information into a Quizlet. There is nothing about this process that stimulates sustained learning. The Monikos application is a unique solution to poor retention rates of critical, yet simple information.
